{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
if the {bf:mini} engine is not used, 
{bf:markdoc} requires the  {browse "http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html":wkhtmltopdf} 
software to convert {bf:html} to {bf:pdf} without requiring installing LaTeX. 
Moreove, {bf:markdoc} provides automatic installation of wkhtmltopdf, if desired. 

{p 4 4 2}
However, {bf:markdoc} is not the only software that deals with documents in Stata 
and many users show interest to create dynamic documents in their own way. 
to help them create {bf:pdf} documents, this command was created to convert their 
{bf:html} documents to {bf:pdf}. 


{title:Example}

{p 4 4 2}
convert html file to pdf

        . wkhtmltopdf myfile.html myfile.pdf
