#use_custom_datasignature
# how to determine whether a .dta file has changed
#False: use standard MD5 hash for .dta files. 
#   Because Stata embeds a timestamp in .dta files, the standard MD5 hash 
#     will change each time the file is re-written, even if there are no 
#     substantive changes in the file 
#DataOnly: use Stata's datasignature to calculate time-invariant hash 
#   that depends on data only, not metadata (variable or value labels)
#Strict: use custom_datasignature.ado to calculate time-invariant hash 
#   that depends on data and metadata (variable or value labels)
use_custom_datasignature: Strict
