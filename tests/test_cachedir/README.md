This example shows how to use (and tests) the cachedir feature of scons. We test this by having 2 project folders on one machine share a local cachedir. It could also be done with 2 differenent users having a shared (e.g., via Dropbox or NFS) cachedir. The project folders have the same code and their SConstruct's point to the same cachedir. If both are clean, and we build all in Copy1 and then in Copy2, they will actually get built in the first and just retrieved in the second.
